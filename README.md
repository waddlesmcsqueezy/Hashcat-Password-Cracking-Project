# Hashcat-Password-Cracking-Project
This was a project between me and 3 other group members as part of a Systems Security class final project.
## The Idea
Our idea and goal was to successfully utilize existing tools and repositories such as Hashcat, Mimikatz, dive.rule, and rockyou.txt to identify the password of a local windows user account.
## The Files
### passwords.txt
this file has the passwords that were hashed and later identified by hashcat
### hashes.txt
this file contains the post-hashed passwords
### cracked.txt
this file is what hashcat generated after use that shows what hashes equated to what password
